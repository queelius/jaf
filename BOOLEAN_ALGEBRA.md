**Motivation**

Treating JAF query results (lists of indices) as sets allows us to apply boolean algebra (AND, OR, NOT) to combine them. This is beneficial because:

1.  **Modularity**: Complex filtering logic can be built by combining simpler, named, or pre-computed JAF queries. For example, you could find "active users" with one query, "developers" with another, and then find "active developers" by ANDing their result sets.
2.  **Clarity**: It can make intricate filtering logic easier to express and understand by breaking it down into distinct steps.
3.  **Reusability**: Saved result sets can be reused in multiple compositions without re-running the underlying JAF queries if the data hasn't changed.
4.  **Formal Semantics**: It leverages the well-understood principles of boolean algebra and set theory, providing a solid conceptual foundation.

While the JAF query language itself has `and`, `or`, `not` for "inner logic" within a single query evaluation, this "outer logic" operates on the *outputs* of one or more JAF queries.

**Defining `JafResultSet`**

We can introduce a class, let's call it `JafResultSet`, to represent the set of indices that satisfy a query, along with metadata to ensure logical consistency when combining results.

**`JafResultSet` Class Attributes:**

*   `indices`: A `set` of integers representing the indices of the objects from the original data array that matched the query.
*   `collection_size`: An integer indicating the total number of items in the original data collection. This is crucial for the `NOT` operation, as it defines the "universe" of all possible indices.
*   `collection_id`: An optional, user-provided identifier (e.g., a string, a UUID) for the original data collection. This helps ensure that boolean operations are only performed between result sets derived from the *same logical collection* of data.

**`JafResultSet` Core Methods (Boolean Algebra):**

Each of these methods would return a *new* `JafResultSet` instance.

1.  `AND(self, other_result_set: 'JafResultSet') -> 'JafResultSet'`:
    *   Performs a set intersection of `self.indices` and `other_result_set.indices`.
    *   **Compatibility Check**: Before operating, it must verify that `other_result_set` has the same `collection_size` and, if both `collection_id`s are set, that they are identical. If not, it should raise an error to prevent operations on results from different or incompatible datasets.

2.  `OR(self, other_result_set: 'JafResultSet') -> 'JafResultSet'`:
    *   Performs a set union.
    *   Includes the same compatibility checks as `AND`.

3.  `NOT(self) -> 'JafResultSet'`:
    *   Calculates the complement. This involves creating a set of all possible indices from `0` to `self.collection_size - 1`, and then finding the set difference with `self.indices`.

4.  `XOR(self, other_result_set: 'JafResultSet') -> 'JafResultSet'`: (Optional but standard)
    *   Performs a set symmetric difference.
    *   Includes compatibility checks.

5.  `SUBTRACT(self, other_result_set: 'JafResultSet') -> 'JafResultSet'`: (A AND NOT B)
    *   Performs set difference (`self.indices - other_result_set.indices`).
    *   Includes compatibility checks.

**Integration with the jaf function:**

The main `jaf` function, which currently returns `List[int]`, would be modified:
*   Its signature would change to optionally accept a `collection_id`.
*   It would return a `JafResultSet` instance, populated with the resulting indices, the `len(data)` as `collection_size`, and the provided `collection_id`.

Example:
`def jaf(data: List[Dict], query: Union[List, str], collection_id: Optional[Any] = None) -> JafResultSet:`
And the return statement within `jaf` would become something like:
`return JafResultSet(list_of_matching_indices, len(data), collection_id)`

**Addressing Your Considerations:**

*   **Universe for NOT**: The `collection_size` attribute in `JafResultSet` explicitly defines this universe.
*   **Collection Consistency**: The `collection_size` and `collection_id` attributes, along with the compatibility checks in the boolean operation methods, address the concern of applying algebra over results from different collections. An error would be raised if an attempt is made to combine incompatible `JafResultSet` instances. The `collection_id` acts as the "hash" or identifier you mentioned, ensuring operations are well-defined.

This design provides a robust and semantically clear way to work with and combine the results of JAF queries, building upon the core filtering capabilities. We can proceed to implement this `JafResultSet` class.
